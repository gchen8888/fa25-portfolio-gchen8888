# Heat Exchanger Analysis (ENGRD 2210 Thermodynamics Portfolio)

This project analyzes the performance of a small water-to-water heat exchanger operated in **counterflow** vs **parallel flow** setup. Experimental data was collected using two pumps, four water reservoirs, an immersion heater, ice, thermocouples, and dye for flow tracing.

# Description of the Heat Exchanger

A heat exchanger transfers thermal energy between two fluid streams passing through one another without mixing.  

In my experiment, there are: 
- **Hot stream:** Water heated by an immersion heater  
- **Cold stream:** Water cooled by ice   
- **Two pumps** circulate the fluids  
- The heat exchanger has **four labeled ports** 1, 2, 3, 4

This experiment focuses on comparing: 
- **Counterflow:** fluids move in opposite directions  
- **Parallel flow:** fluids move in the same direction

Real-world examples of heat exchanger include:
- Radiator in a car
- Coils at the back of a refrigerator



# Analysis 
Counterflow is expected to perform better because the **largest temperature difference** occurs along the full length of the exchanger.
