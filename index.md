Hi! My name is Gina Chen, and I’m a passionate environmental engineering student at Cornell University. 
I am particularly interested in sustainable design, energy systems, and applications through thermodynamics. I've learned lots of knowledge and developed strong skills in system analysis and problem-solving through my engineering studies, and I am excited to apply these skills in the professional world.

Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
